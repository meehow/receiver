# Receiver

**Discover radio stations you'd never find on your own.**

Most radio apps make you search for stations by name or paste in a stream URL. Receiver flips that around — it ships with **30,000+ stations** ready to explore, each one verified and working, with clean logos, organized by tags, country and language. Just open the app and start discovering.

## Why Receiver?

Every station in Receiver has been **individually scanned** to verify it's reachable and actually streaming. Duplicates have been removed, broken streams filtered out, and logos fetched in proper resolution — so what you see is a clean, reliable station list, not a dump of 50,000 half-dead URLs.

No sign-up. No ads. No popularity rankings deciding what you hear. Just radio.
